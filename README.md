- [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/Ea0aXZPZJBl8bAkpuYjh6a/Go-Dutch-Public?node-id=0%3A1)

## Built with

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind

### Some other tools that made my work easier

- [Tailwind Forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms)
- [Headless UI - Radio Group](https://headlessui.com/react/radio-group)

## What I learned

- How to use Headless UI's Radio Group component, which makes working with radio inputs a breeze. It provides differents states of the input (checked, active) which we can use to style the elements.
- How to keep forms simple: I initially thought that I could use React Hook Form, but it has a learning curve, which significantly slowed me down in building the app.
